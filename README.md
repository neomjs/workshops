# neo.mjs workshop for experienced WebDevs

Welcome to the code repository for the neo.mjs workshops for experienced web developers!

In this workshop series, we aim to **teach the community** of interested developers how to **build great apps with neo**! If you are interested in an invite, [join our Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/neomjs/shared_invite/zt-1btl4kuc7-~FOMG0iGOVi_K7sjRbY3rA) and ping us!

The list of topics/content for future workshops is currently still under construction, so your input is very welcome (one more reason to join our Slack!)

The workshop sessions are being recorded and will be publically published online at some later date. You are welcome to forward the invitation to interested colleagues in your network!

This repo contains the code for all past workshop sessions (in the commit history), so you can play around with it after attending or viewing workshop recordings.
