### 2022/07/05: _app/MyForm_ - a first dive into databinding and `ViewModel`s

1. In `MainContainerController`, import and create a `Dialog` when clicking the "Accept" button

1. Inside this dialog...
    1. Show some bound value from the `ViewModel`
    1. In the `TextField`, add a min. length of 2 characters (as a validation rule)
    1. Show a button titled "Validate" which triggers a validation check for the form **in the `MainContainer` view**
    1. Show a second button titled "Reset" which resets the form in `MainContainer` (to its starting values) & closes the dialog
